        <h2>A.T.M Reflection</h2>
        <p> A.T.M was a really fun experience throughout these 3 years. I learned so much about computers which I think will really help my career that has to do with computers. I think this will also help me in the future in general. Typing without looking at my fingers is something amazing that I personally thought would never achieve in my life. I think that I type at a really good speed / wpm but I really need to work on typing the numbers without looking at my fingers. That is and will hopefully be a goal that I will achieve. Learning about websites, microsoft, powerpoint, and coding are really helping me right now in my classes. When I have projects I know how to use these applications. Coding now helps me in 8th grade since we are learning how to make websites. All I have to say is that these learning skills will help me in the future and are helping me in the present. I really recommend joining this program because it is really fun and something also enjoyable. </p>

        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p> There are 6 people in my family, my parents, my siblings, and myself. I have 3 sisters, one aged 21, another 19, and one aged 12. I also have a dog named Athena that is 3 years old and is the race of lhasa apso. She is the cutest thing that I have seen and I love her with all of my heart. My older sister went to Italy in the august of 2016 to study there for a year, which she says she is really enjoying. My sister that is 19 started college this year, 2016, and finally my younger sister and I, are still attending middle school. I also have family in Mexico which I love and adore, I have them on both my parents side. One of my aunt lives in Fresno californa and I somewhat go visit her. My family is one of a kind and really fun people to be around of.</p>
